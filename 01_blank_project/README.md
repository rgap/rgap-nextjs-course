## Overview

`01_blank_project` is a stripped-down Next.js App Router starter. All stock marketing content and sample styles were removed so you can focus on learning exercises without digging through demo clutter. The single `Home` component renders a hero section that proves the app boots correctly.

## What You Practice

- Bootstrapping a clean App Router project with only `layout.js`, `page.js`, and `globals.css`.
- Updating root metadata and global styles to match your own project branding.
- Verifying the automatic favicon wiring that Next.js handles when `src/app/favicon.ico` exists.

## How To Use It

Run `npm install` followed by `npm run dev`, then start building features directly in `src/app`. Treat this project as the baseline for future lessons—copy it whenever you need a blank slate or want to compare new concepts against the simplest possible setup.
